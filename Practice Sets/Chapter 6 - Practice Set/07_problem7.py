post = "Last Saturday, Karan, Neha, Rohan, and Simran decided to go on a spontaneous road trip to the hills of Mussoorie. Riya packed snacks while Kabir took charge of the playlist, filling the car with laughter and old Bollywood tunes. Along the way, they picked up Ishaan, who brought his camera to capture every moment. When they reached the top, Tanya surprised everyone with a cake to celebrate Rohan's early birthday. As the sun set, the group sat around a small bonfire, sharing stories and memories, already planning their next adventure together."
